# over_react_codemod

A tool to convert Over React components from Dart 1 to Dart 2. Uses the
[Codemod](https://github.com/Facebook/codemod) library.

The script requires a [custom branch](https://github.com/georgelesica-wf/codemod/tree/dart-convert)
of `codemod`. Install it however you want (virtual environment, or whatever).

To use, just run the Python script in the Dart repo you want to update.
